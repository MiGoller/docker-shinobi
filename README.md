## Asking for help

Before asking questions it would nice if you read the docs :) http://shinobi.video

After doing so please head on over to the Discord community chat for support. https://discordapp.com/invite/mdhmvuH

The Issues section is only for bugs with the software. Comments and feature requests may be closed without comment. http://shinobi.video/docs/contribute

Please be considerate of developer efforts. If you have simple questions, like "what does this button do?", please be sure to have read the docs entirely before asking. If you would like to skip reading the docs and ask away you can order a support package :) http://shinobi.video/support

## Making Suggestions or Feature Requests

You can post suggestions in the Discord #suggestions channel. Please do not treat this channel like a "demands" window. Developer efforts are limited. Much more than many alternatives.

when you have a suggestion please try and make the changes yourself then post a pull request to the `dev` branch. Then we can decide if it's a good change for Shinobi. If you don't know how to go about it and want to have me put it higher on my priority list you can order a support package :) Pretty Ferengi of me... but until we live in a world without money please support Shinobi :) Cheers!

# What others say

> "After trying zoneminder without success (heavy unstable and slow) I passed to Shinobi that despite being young spins a thousand times better (I have a setup with 16 cameras recording in FHD to ~ 10fps on a pentium of ~ 2009 and I turn with load below 1.5)."

> *A Reddit user, /r/ItalyInformatica*

&nbsp;

> "I would suggest Shinobi as a NVR. It's still in the early days but works a lot better than ZoneMinder for me. I'm able to record 16 cams at 1080p 15fps continously whith no load on server (Pentium E5500 3GB RAM) where zm crashed with 6 cams at 720p. Not to mention the better interface."
